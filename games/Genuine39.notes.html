      <html>      <b> modified by: John Halucha </b> <br> The clock has ticked past midnight Sept. 1, 1939. France, Britain and Poland<br> have pledged allegiance while Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia have a pact and<br> secret protocol to partition Poland between them. Italy has linked with Germany <br> in the Pact of Steel, and is included in the scenario though it did not fight against <br> the Allies until 1940. The USA does not fight until late 1941, but is included since <br> it gave aid to the Allies earlier. The game does not allow France to capitulate and <br> become an ally of Germany as it did in June 1940. Nor will the game let Germany <br> attack Soviet troops occupying eastern Poland as it did in June 1941, turning the <br> Russians from a friend of Germany into a foe. So alliances in the game remain: <br> <br>       <table border="0"bgcolor="444444">      <tr>      <th style="font-size:120%;color:red"colspan="2">Alliances</th>     </tr>     <tr>     <th bgcolor="DD0000">Axis Powers</th>     <th bgcolor="CCBBAA">Allied Powers</th>     </tr>     <tr>     <td bgcolor="DD0000">Nazi Germany</td>     <td bgcolor="CCBBAA">Poland</td>     </tr>     <tr>     <td bgcolor="DD0000">Soviet Russia</td>     <td bgcolor="CCBBAA">United Kingdom</td>     </tr>     <tr>     <td bgcolor="DD0000">Italy</td>     <td bgcolor="CCBBAA">France</td>     </tr>     <tr>     <td bgcolor="DD0000"> </td>     <td bgcolor="CCBBAA">UnitedStates</td>     </tr>     </table>     <br> Turn order corresponds to historical fact: Germany attacking Poland on Sept. 1, <br> Poland defending itself the same day, UK declaring war Sept. 3 followed by France <br> later that day, and Soviet Russia attacking Poland Sept. 17. Italy declared war in <br> 1940 and Germany declared war on the USA in 1941. <br> <br>  <table border="0"bgcolor="CCBBAA"> <tr> <th>Turn order: Germany, Poland, UK, France, Russia, Italy, US.</th> </table> <br>  Some national boundaries and territory names have been adjusted from the <br> base map to reflect the actual situation on Sept. 1, 1939. Starting relative <br> economic and military strengths are also based on historical fact, as are <br> starting locations of military units. <br>  <br>     <b>============== For extended historical emulation:===============</b><br> <br> Human players are free to make sovereign decisions from the start but may <br> choose to mimic actual political choices that were made until almost 1942, when <br> the original Axis and Allies game start is set: <br> <br> Germans: Attack Poland but do not attack any other Allies on land until Poland <br> is defeated by you and the Russians, and you divide Poland between you. This <br> lets you move more units west before attacking France or Neutral territories in the <br> west. Attack British and French ships from the start, but not American naval units. <br> After Poland is partitioned between you and the Russians, attack Neutral countries <br> starting with Denmark and Norway. Then invade neutrals Netherlands and Belgium <br> at the same time as Allied France. <br> <br> Polish: Hold off alone as long as possible against the Germans attacking from the <br> west, and later the Russians attacking from the east. Do not initiate attack on either <br> superpower or any Neutral territories: your role is to tie up enemy forces to allow <br> the British and French to open a western front on the Germans as they pledged. <br> <br> British: Do not attack German or Italian land units or bomb Germany until the <br> Germans attack the French. However, you may attack German ships. Do not <br> attack any Russian units on land or sea, even after Russians attack your Ally, <br> Poland. Do not attack any Neutral territories except those taken by the Germans. <br> Do not attack any Neutral territories taken by the Russians. You may transfer units <br> to France at any time, including before the Germans attack France. <br> <br> French: You may build up defences behind your Maginot Line but do not attack <br> or bomb enemy targets until the Germans attack you. Do not attack or bomb <br> Russian targets. Do not attack or bomb any Italian targets until the Italians <br> attack you. Do not attack any Neutral territories, unless those areas have been <br> taken by the Germans. Do not attack any Neutral territories taken by the Russians <br> or Italians. But you may invade neutral Belgium after the Germans attack you.<br> <br> Russians: Attack Poland but not other Allies. After Poland is defeated, attack <br> Neutral territories, starting with Finland and the Baltic States.<br> <br> Italians: Do not attack French or British units or territories until the Germans are <br> on the outskirts of Paris. After that, attack the French and British along with <br> Neutral territories, starting with Greece.<br> <br> Americans: Do not attack any Axis units or territories until a minimum one round <br> after continental France has been overrun, to emulate US delay in entering the war <br> until the end of 1941 more than a year after France capitulated. This includes <br> not engaging Axis naval units until that time although you may fire if fired upon. <br> Also, from the beginning your naval units may escort Allied shipping in the Atlantic <br> as far as Iceland.<br> <br> All history-based restrictions cease one round after continental France has been <br> overrun (1940) since in 1941 German troops occupying western Poland attacked <br> Soviet troops occupying eastern Poland and the German-Soviet alliance was thus <br> broken, which this game does not allow. <br> <br>  <b>================== Unit Values (MODIFIED)==================</b><br>      <table border="0"bgcolor="DD0000">     <tr>      <th>Unit</th>     <th>Cost</th>     <th>Att</th>     <th>Def</th>     <th>Move</th>     <th>TransCost </th>     <th>TransCap</th>     <th>Ability</th>     </tr>      <tr bgcolor="CCBBAA">     <td>Infantry</td>     <td>2</td>     <td>1</td>     <td>2</td>     <td>1</td>     <td>2</td>     <td></td>     <td>artil-supportable</td>     </tr>      <td>Cavalry</td>     <td>3</td>     <td>1</td>     <td>2</td>     <td>2</td>     <td>2</td>     <td></td>     <td>art-sup</td>     </tr>      <tr bgcolor="CCBBAA">     <td>Mot.Inf</td>     <td>4</td>     <td>1</td>     <td>2</td>     <td>2</td>     <td>3</td>     <td></td>     <td>art-sup,blitz</td>     </tr>       <td>Mech.Inf</td>     <td>6</td>     <td>1</td>     <td>2</td>     <td>3</td>     <td>3</td>     <td></td>     <td>art-sup,blitz</td>     </tr>       <tr bgcolor="CCBBAA">     <td>Artillery</td>     <td>4</td>     <td>2</td>     <td>2</td>     <td>1</td>     <td>3</td>     <td></td>     <td>artillery</td>     </tr>       <td>Tankette</td>     <td>5</td>     <td>2</td>     <td>2</td>     <td>2</td>     <td>3</td>     <td></td>     <td>art-sup,blitz</td>     <td></td>     </tr>       <tr bgcolor="CCBBAA">     <td>Armour/Panzer</td>     <td>7</td>     <td>3</td>     <td>3</td>     <td>2</td>     <td>3</td>     <td></td>     <td>art-sup,blitz</td>     <td></td>     </tr>       <td>Bunker</td>     <td>5</td>     <td>0</td>     <td>3</td>     <td>0</td>     <td></td>     <td></td>     <td>2hit</td>     </tr>       <tr bgcolor="CCBBAA">     <td>EarlyFighter</td>     <td>8</td>     <td>2</td>     <td>3</td>     <td>3</td>     <td>1Carr</td>     <td></td>     <td></td>     </tr>       <td>Fighter</td>     <td>12</td>     <td>3</td>     <td>4</td>     <td>4</td>     <td>1Carr</td>     <td></td>     <td></td>     </tr>      <tr bgcolor="CCBBAA">     <td>Bomber</td>     <td>15</td>     <td>4</td>     <td>1</td>     <td>6</td>     <td>2Carr</td>     <td></td>     <td></td>     </tr>      <td>Transport</td>     <td>4</td>     <td>0</td>     <td>1</td>     <td>2</td>     <td></td>     <td>5</td>     <td></td>     </tr>      <tr bgcolor="CCBBAA">     <td>T.Boat</td>     <td>3</td>     <td>2</td>     <td>2</td>     <td>1</td>     <td></td>     <td></td>     <td>art-sup</td>     <td></td>     <td></td>     </tr>      <tr>      <td>Submarine</td>     <td>6</td>     <td>2</td>     <td>2</td>     <td>2</td>     <td></td>     <td></td>     <td>submersible</td>     </tr>       <tr bgcolor="CCBBAA">     <td>Destroyer</td>     <td>7</td>     <td>3</td>     <td>3</td>     <td>2</td>     <td></td>     <td></td>     <td>anti-sub,art-sup</td>     </tr>       <td>Carrier</td>     <td>10</td>     <td>2</td>     <td>3</td>     <td>2</td>     <td></td>     <td>2Carr</td>     <td>art-sup</td>     </tr>      <tr bgcolor="CCBBAA">     <td>Cruiser</td>     <td>13</td>     <td>3</td>     <td>4</td>     <td>2</td>     <td></td>     <td>2</td>     <td>trans,bmbard,art-sup</td>     </tr>       <td>Battleship</td>     <td>18</td>     <td>4</td>     <td>5</td>     <td>2</td>     <td></td>     <td></td>     <td>bmbard,artil,2Hit</td>     </tr>      <tr bgcolor="CCBBAA">     <td>Factory</td>     <td>20</td>     <td>0</td>     <td>0</td>     <td>0</td>     <td></td>     <td></td>     <td>Stationary Factory</td>     </tr>       <td>General</td>     <td>25</td>     <td>0</td>     <td>0</td>     <td>3</td>     <td>2</td>     <td></td>     <td>Movable Factory</td>     </tr>       <tr bgcolor="CCBBAA">     <th>Unit name</th>     <th>cost</th>     <th>att</th>     <th>def</th>     <th>move</th>     <th>tranCost </th>     <th>tranCap</th>     <th>ability</th>     </tr>     </table>     <br><br>  <b>================== Bunker Rules ==================</b><br>  * For every territory, owned at the start of the turn, a maximum of  <br> ONE Bunker can be purchased PER TURN. <br>   <br> <b>Original map baseframe credit to Seig and Ernie Bommel NWO1939 <br> and modifications Adolf Lebowski
